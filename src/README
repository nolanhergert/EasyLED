Try to compile in a library locally to PlatformIO so you can set the default of the logging to true. https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/blob/master/libraries/ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer/src/ESP8266HTTPUpdateServer.h

Also try to make the ESP8266 set up so android/others don't complain about not having web access and boot you off the network when on home wifi.
