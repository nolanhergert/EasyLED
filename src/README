Should save off previous settings in a backwards compatible and forwards compatible way.
  * Use ESP_EEPROM library too

Also try to make the ESP8266 set up so android/others don't complain about not having web access and boot you off the network when on home wifi.
  * It's a setting on Android/iPhone to accept this

Allow to set wifi credentials and whether to connect to a home wifi instead.

Should have a way to reset EEPROM settings back to normal, externally 
controllable without opening hot glue case?

Popup screen should have:
  * Number of LEDs on strip, or if it has something else on it (Servo, motor, horn, single PWM led)
  * Pattern
  * Speed
  * Set colors (primary colors?)
  * Paste script? (can be dynamic)


Pattern offset from another strip? Duplicated?

Pattern programming. Transition time + list of patterns.
